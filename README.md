<h3 align="center">Pac-xon</h3>
<p>
  Re-creation of a game with the same name, where player as a pac-man tries to gather 80% of available space to win with ghosts.
</p>

<h3 align="center">Rules</h3>
<p>
Gameplay: Take over 80% of the field by moving with arrow keys and avoid the ghosts. If you run into a ghost or it crosses your line while you are not in a safe zone, you lose a life. Be careful, you have only three of those, if u lose all of them, game restarts.  

Enemies: Pink ghosts are just bouncing around and can be eaten by other ghosts, what makes them disappear from the map. 
Orange ghosts travel close to safe zone boarders.
Red ghosts destroy save zone as they bounce off the walls.

<!-- TECHNOLOGIES -->
## Technologies
To create our game we used Python 3.9. 

| Library             | Usage                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| pygame              | Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows us to create fully featured games and   multimedia programs in the python language. |
| threading           | Threading is a Python module that allows us to have different parts of our program run concurrently.|
| numpy               | Numpy simplifies working with array what allows us to easily manipulate board of our game |
| scipy               | Scipy in our project is used for labeling arrays |
